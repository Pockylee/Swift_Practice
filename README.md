# SwiftUI Tutorial Project

This repository contains the completed project and code examples from the SwiftUI tutorial provided by Apple Developer. The tutorial is designed to introduce you to the SwiftUI framework, which allows you to build user interfaces across all Apple platforms with the power of Swift.

## Overview

SwiftUI is a modern way to declare user interfaces for any Apple platform. Create beautiful, dynamic apps faster than ever before. SwiftUI provides views, controls, and layout structures for declaring your app’s user interface. SwiftUI is integrated into all of Apple’s platforms, which means you can enjoy the same code and APIs everywhere.

## Tutorials Covered

This project includes the following tutorials from the [Apple Developer SwiftUI tutorial](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui):

1. **Creating and Combining Views**
    - Learn how to create custom views with SwiftUI.
    - Combine and compose views to create more complex layouts.

2. **Building Lists and Navigation**

5. **Composing Complex Interfaces**
    - Build more complex interfaces by combining multiple views.
    - Use stacks, grids, and custom layouts to organize your content.

6. **Working with UI Controls**
    - Utilize built-in SwiftUI controls like buttons, toggles, and pickers.
    - Customize controls to fit the look and feel of your app.

7. **Integrating SwiftUI with UIKit**
